          Jeff was born in upstate NY and spent his childhood playing lacrosse,
          video games, and running track. His favorite snack is peanut butter
          on pretty much anything.

          "I know the husband is supposed to be the "rock", but Marisa has always
          been mine. She's helped me grow into the best man I can be. She is
          supportive, loving, and beautiful (of course). I still can't believe
          she's going to be mine forever!!

          Marisa and I met on Halloween night, 2005 (whoa!). She didn't know it then,
          but she was going to be seeing a LOT of the boy in the Cornell hoodie for
          the rest of her life."

    <h1>The Engagement</h1>
    <p>
      Jeff tells the story:
    </p>
    <p>
      We got engaged at
      <a href='http://www.skihomewood.com/'>Homewood Ski Resort</a>
      in Lake Tahoe, CA. As usual, I winged it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got the ring the day before we left for our ski vacation, and even as
      the ski chair reached the top of the mountain, he had no idea what to do.
      Luckily, it was Marisa that prompted, "Hey, let's take pictures at this
      nice clearing area." Thank god for those Momma B photog genes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After we snapped a few photos, with the incredible Lake Tahoe scenery in
      the background, I dropped to one knee. I started to stammer out the
      proposal I had been turning over in my mind, but before I could get even
      a few words out, Marisa completely lost it. You'll just have to see for
      yourself below, and
