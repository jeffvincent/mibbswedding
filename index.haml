      a beautiful barn, bar, and lodge near Tilton, NH. It's situated on a whole
      ton of acres, and it's got a great view, pond, the whole deal.

      I know the husband is supposed to be the "rock", but Marisa has always
      been mine. She's helped me grow into the best man I can be. She is
      supportive, loving, and beautiful (of course). I still can't believe
      she's going to be mine forever!!

      Marisa and I met on Halloween night, 2005 (whoa!). She didn't know it then, 
      but she was going to be seeing a LOT of the boy in the Cornell hoodie for 
      the rest of her life.

    %h1 The Engagement
    %p
      We got engaged at 
      %a{ href: 'http://www.skihomewood.com/' } Homewood Ski Resort
      in Lake Tahoe, CA. As usual, Jeff winged it. He had the ring ready to go,
      sure, but even as the ski chair reached the top of the mountain, he had 
      no idea what to do. Luckily, it was Marisa that prompted, "Hey, let's 
      take pictures at this nice clearing area." Thank god for those Momma B 
      photog genes.

      After we snapped a few photos, with the incredible Lake Tahoe scenery in 
      the background, I dropped to one knee. I started to stammer out the 
      proposal I had been turning over in my mind, but before I could get even 
      a few words out, Marisa completely lost it. You'll just have to see for 
      yourself below, and
